# CVE-2020-1971
# The X.509 GeneralName type is a generic type for representing different types
# of names. One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a
# function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME
# to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both
# GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash
# may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. 
# OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes:
#
# 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL
#    distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate.
#
# 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp
#    authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and
#    TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared
#    then that attacker could trigger a crash.
#
# All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue. Fixed in OpenSSL
# 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2x (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2w).
#
# In order to support FIPS with OpenSSL we are required to use OpenSSL version
# 1.0.2 until OpenSSL supports the FIPS module in newer versions. The latest
# available version to us is 1.0.2u, which does not include this fix.
#
# We've determined that we are not impacted by this vulnerability because:
# - we do not directly perform CRL checks in the Conjur or DAP software
# - we do not enable automatic CRL checks in openssl tools
# - we do not call any of the impacted OpenSSL APIs or any of the APIs that expose
#   impacted behavior.
