The Application deployment is complete.
The following have been deployed:
- A sample "Pet Store" application that uses a Kubernetes Secret to configure
  its backend database credentials.
- A CyberArk Secrets Provider Job that, upon startup, updates the Kubernetes
  Secret that is used by the "Pet Store" application with backend database
  credentials that the Secrets Provider has retrieved from Conjur.

Application is now available at test-app-secrets-provider-standalone.{{ .Release.Namespace }}.svc.cluster.local
